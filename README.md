# Pac-Man Replica Project

This project was used as the final product for my IB computer science course, in which I replicated the game Pac-Man from the ground up in Java. Pac-Man is controlled via the arrow keys, and apart from some features like food and different algorithms for each ghost, the game functions very similarly to how Pac-Man does normally.
